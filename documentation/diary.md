### 28th May 2019
#### Starting with React Native

Initial setup of the project
```
$ brew install watchman
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
$  react-native init fullstackproject
```

After initialization I opened Xcode. I had done some projects with it before so there
was no need to set up anything. I connected my iPhone to my MacBook and then
 simply opened the project on Xcode and clicked `Build & Run`. 

It also opened Metro Bundler CLI, which monitors for changes in JS files. 

The app opened on my iPhone and then I shaked it to enable live reload. After that
any change I made in VSCode to App.js file triggered almost instant reload on the iPhone.
Cool, time to start the actual coding.
